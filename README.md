After completing the requested implementation, Iâ€™ve outlined the solution and code design below to emphasize scalability and maintainability.

1. Scalable Job Fetching via Bull Queue
   Integrated BullQueue with Redis to offload and manage the fetching and transformation of data from external APIs.

Allows retries, backoff, and concurrent job processing.

Easily extendable to support additional APIs by registering new processors.

2. Database Indexing for Performance
   Added proper indexes on frequently queried fields like title, location, salaryMin, salaryMax, and skills to optimize filtering and pagination performance.

Ensures fast query execution as data volume grows.

3. Comprehensive Filtering & Skill Support
   Developed a robust /api/job-offers endpoint with the following query filters:

title (case-insensitive partial match)

location

salaryMin, salaryMax

skills (array-based match)

Pagination is built-in and uses configurable limits.

4. Centralized & Robust Error Handling
   Implemented a global exception filter and service-level try/catch wrappers.

API returns meaningful and consistent error responses (e.g., validation errors return 400 with detailed messages).

External API failures are logged and retried gracefully.

5. Database Migration Strategy
   Used TypeORM migrations to manage schema changes.

Supports versioned updates to the schema, enabling safe rollouts and CI/CD integration.

Migration files are automatically generated and reviewed before deployment.

6. End-to-End and Unit Testing
   Wrote e2e tests for all critical flows:

Success cases (200 OK)

Invalid query scenarios (400 Bad Request)

Filtering logic combinations

Unit tests cover:

Cron job scheduling behavior (CornService)

Used Supertest for API simulation and Jest for test coverage.

Additional Notes on Scalability & Maintainability
Modular structure: APIs, services, queues, and DTOs are decoupled and follow the single responsibility principle.

Environment-based configuration: Cron frequency, queue concurrency, and API endpoints are all configurable via .env or config service.

Duplicate handling: Implemented checks using unique constraints and upsert logic to avoid storing duplicates during periodic fetches.
